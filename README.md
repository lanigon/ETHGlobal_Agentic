Our Project is a Web3 social game where players chat with an AI bartender to earn tokens and write letters to connect with others. 
Deep conversations are rewarded with NFTs and in-game perks, creating a space for meaningful interactions in a cyberpunk bar.
We just deploy contracts on Flow Network.

Our team is a student team, most of us are postgraduate student majoring in Blockchain.
